# Bootstrap_Example_Project
Example of a basic Bootstrap project I made, mocking up a website for coffee. This was made independently based off the requirements given in the Udemy Python and Django Full Stack Course.

Very basic example of a quick HTML site made using Bootstrap. Consists of two pages linked together with no backend or real functionality.
